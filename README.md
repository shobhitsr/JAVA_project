This repository contains JAVA projects

The projects included in this repository are:

1: Implementation of Henderson's Method: In this project we start with the number 1000 and start substracting by 1 repeatedly from it untill a number ending with zero appears. Then switch to substracting by 2 and so on. The execution stops when the next substraction causes a negative number.

2: Text Numerology: In this project numerology is used to assign a numerical value to a string based on values assigned to the individual letters according to a variety of rules.

3: Movie Similarity: In this project I created a recommender system that processes a list of movies and a matrix of similarities between the movies to use pearson r correlation to find movies similar to the movie entered in the prompt.

4: Demo Calculater: In this project I created a simple calculator to understand how the GUI works and understand some of the basic functionailties of NetBeans.
